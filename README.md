Code in the Dark
================

My [Code in the Dark](https://github.com/codeinthedark/codeinthedark.github.io#what-is-code-in-the-dark)
competition implementations.

From the [Code in the Dark GitHub repo](https://github.com/codeinthedark/codeinthedark.github.io#what-is-code-in-the-dark):

> [Code in the Dark](http://codeinthedark.com) is a front-end (HTML, CSS)
> competition, originating from [Tictail](https://tictail.com),
> where each contestant compete to implement a website design
> given only a screenshot.
> The catch is that no previews of the results are allowed
> during the implementation, and no measuring tools can be used.
> The winner is decided by the audience.
