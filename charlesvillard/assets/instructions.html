--- The rules ---
1) No previews - of either results or assets!
2) Stay in this editor at all times
3) No measurement tools
4) Stop coding when the time's up
5) Use the "Download file" button and save the file as design.html in the same folder as the editor.

Good luck and most important of all; have fun!

--- ASSETS ---

--- Fonts Assets ---
The Google fonts Open Sans and Roboto Slab are the fonts used primarily throughout the site. 
To include the Google Font, put the following in your HEAD tag:

&lt;link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:800|Roboto+Slab:400,700' 
      rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;

You will of course, need to declare the font-family property in your CSS.
